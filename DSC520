#1.) Yes, the data is unimodel. It has one clear peak at 90.
#2.) The data is not symmetrical. The data peaks much more on the right compared to the left.
#3.) The data is not bell-shaped. It does not peak in the middle and taper to the left and right.
#4.) The data is not normally distributed.
#5.) The data is skewed to the right.
#6.)

com_histogram2 = ggplot(data=community_df, aes(x=HSDegree)) +
geom_histogram(mapping = aes(y = stat(density)), fill='mediumorchid1', alpha=0.5, colour='black', binwidth =1 ) + stat_function(fun = dnorm,
args = list(mean = mean(community_df$HSDegree), sd = sd(community_df$HSDegree)),
color = 'red') + ggtitle("High School Degree Distribution") + xlab("High School Degree") + ylab("Degree Count") #Added a normal curve

#7.) A normal distribution is probability that is symmetric around the mean. The graph here shows that the data is not symmetrically around the mean. #V.) Create a probability plot of HSDegree
prob_plot<- ggplot(mapping = aes(sample = community_df$HSDegree)) + stat_qq_point(size = 2, color = "green")

#VI-1.) A normally distributed probability plot would show a straight line. The probability plot for "HSDegree" is not a straight line. It is curved toward the right, therefore not normally distributed. #VI-2.) The data is skewed toward the right. The probability plot curves toward the right, showing a right-skew.
#VII.)
round(stat.desc(community_df$HSDegree, basic=TRUE, desc=TRUE, norm=TRUE, p=0.95), digits = 2)
#VIII.) The stat.desc shows a skewness of -1.67. Negative skewness shows a pile-up on the right side of the data, which this is.
# A positive kurtosis shows a pointy and heavy-tailed distribution. This means there is a lot of data on the extremes, or edges of the distribution.
# The Skew.2Se, or Z score, is -4.03, showing not much data reliability in the sample size. The Kurt.SE is 5.27, showing that the sample of the population with high kurtosis is greater. #Increasing the sample size will likely increase the data reliability, or the reliability of results.
